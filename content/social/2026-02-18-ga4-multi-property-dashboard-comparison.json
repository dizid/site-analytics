    "GA4 has no multi-property overview. If you run 10 websites, you switch between 10 tabs every morning. I fixed this.",
    "I compared every GA4 multi-property dashboard available in 2026: AgencyAnalytics, Databox, DashThis, AnalyticsPortfolio, and StatPilot. Honest pros, cons, and pricing. No affiliate links.",
    "AgencyAnalytics: $59/mo for 5 clients. Great for agencies generating client reports. Annoying if you just want to monitor your own portfolio — every property still needs manual setup.",
    "Databox: $159/mo for 3 data sources. Powerful if you need GA4 + Stripe + Facebook Ads in one view. Overkill (and expensive) if you just want GA4 data.",
    "DashThis: $49/mo for 3 dashboards. Built for reporting, not monitoring. Fine for sending monthly PDFs to clients. Not designed for checking your own stats at a glance.",
    "AnalyticsPortfolio: $49/mo for 40 sites. Closest to what most portfolio owners actually need. Functional but dated UI, no auto-discovery, manual setup per site.",
    "StatPilot: free for 3 properties, $19/mo for 15. Sign in with Google, properties auto-discovered, dashboard ready in ~2 seconds. No per-site setup. Full comparison: [link in bio]"

  "linkedin_post": "GA4 has a blind spot that affects everyone managing more than two websites: there is no portfolio view.\n\nYou cannot see all your properties at once. You switch between them one at a time via a dropdown. Google Analytics 4 has been the default analytics product for years and this has never been addressed — roll-up properties exist but they require GA4 360 at $50,000/year.\n\nI put together an honest comparison of every multi-property dashboard tool available in 2026: AgencyAnalytics, Databox, DashThis, AnalyticsPortfolio, and StatPilot (which I built).\n\nThe short version:\n\n- Agency reporting tools (AgencyAnalytics, DashThis) are designed for generating client-facing reports, not personal portfolio monitoring. Per-site setup and per-client pricing assumptions work against individual developers.\n\n- Business intelligence tools (Databox) are powerful for cross-channel data but expensive and complex if you just want GA4 data across multiple properties.\n\n- Portfolio-focused tools (AnalyticsPortfolio, StatPilot) are the right category. The difference is the setup experience. AnalyticsPortfolio requires manual connection per property. StatPilot auto-discovers via Google OAuth.\n\nIf you manage multiple websites, the linked comparison might save you an afternoon of research.\n\nStatPilot is free for up to 3 properties if you want to try the auto-discovery approach yourself.",
